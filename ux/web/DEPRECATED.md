# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Legacy HTML Dashboards

**This directory contains legacy standalone HTML dashboard templates that are deprecated and will be removed in a future version.**

## Migration Notice

The standalone HTML dashboards in this directory have been replaced by a modern Vite-based Single Page Application (SPA) located in the `reports-spa/` directory.

### Why the Migration?

The legacy HTML approach had several limitations:
- Each dashboard was a separate HTML file with no navigation between them
- Code duplication across multiple HTML files
- Difficult to maintain and update
- No type safety or modern development tooling
- Limited component reusability

### New Vite SPA Benefits

The new SPA provides:
- ✅ **Unified Experience**: All 4 dashboards in a single application with sidebar navigation
- ✅ **Modern Stack**: React, TypeScript, Vite for better developer experience
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support prevents bugs and improves maintainability
- ✅ **Reusable Components**: Shared chart and UI components across all dashboards
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Optimized bundle with code splitting and tree shaking
- ✅ **Self-Contained**: Still fully self-contained with embedded data, works offline
- ✅ **Professional UI**: Modern design with Tailwind CSS and smooth transitions

## Migration Path

### For Users
When generating dashboards using the CLI (option 5):
- **Choose option B**: Vite SPA bundle (recommended)
- **Avoid option A**: Legacy HTML files (deprecated)

The Vite SPA is the default recommended option and provides the same self-contained, offline-capable experience with a much better user interface.

### For Developers
If you need to add new features or modify dashboards:
1. Work in the `reports-spa/` directory
2. Use React components in `src/components/` and `src/pages/`
3. Follow the existing TypeScript patterns
4. Run `npm run dev` for development
5. Run `npm run build` to generate the production bundle

## Timeline

- **Current Status**: Both legacy HTML and Vite SPA are available
- **Deprecation Date**: October 2025 (Phase 8 of migration)
- **Planned Removal**: TBD (will be announced in future release)

## Technical Details

### Data Source
Both systems use the same JSON data files:
- `ux/web/data/team_sprint_stats.json`
- `ux/web/data/developer_activity.json`

These files are generated by the CLI tool (options 3 and 4) and remain unchanged.

### Generated Output Locations
- **Legacy HTML**: `dist/*.html` (individual files)
- **Vite SPA**: `dist/reports/` (single bundle directory)

Both outputs are self-contained and can be deployed to any web server or viewed offline.
