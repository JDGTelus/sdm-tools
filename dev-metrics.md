## Developer Value Metrics Framework

### The Business Case

Traditional metrics like lines of code or commit count fail to capture actual value delivered. This framework combines quantitative data from CodeCommit/Git and Jira with qualitative code health indicators to measure impact, not just activity.

---

## Proposed KPI Categories

### 1. Business Impact Metrics (Jira + Git Integration)

• Story Point Velocity: Completed story points per sprint per developer
• Cycle Time: Time from first commit to production deployment
• Bug Fix Ratio: Bugs resolved vs. bugs introduced (track via Jira ticket types)
• Feature Delivery Rate: Number of completed features/user stories per quarter

### 2. Code Quality Metrics (Git + Static Analysis)

• Code Churn Rate: % of code rewritten within 2 weeks (indicates rework)
• Defect Density: Bugs per 1000 lines of changed code
• Code Review Efficiency:
• Average time to first review
• Review iteration count before approval
• % of PRs approved without changes
• Technical Debt Ratio: New tech debt introduced vs. resolved (via SonarQube/CodeClimate)

### 3. Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing

• Code Review Participation: Reviews given vs. received ratio
• Documentation Updates: Commits to README/docs relative to code changes
• Knowledge Bus Factor: Number of files only one developer touches

### 4. Engineering Excellence

• Test Coverage Delta: Change in coverage with each PR
• Build Success Rate: % of commits that pass CI/CD first attempt
• Security Vulnerability Score: Issues flagged by security scanners per commit
• Dependency Management: Outdated dependencies updated proactively

## Recommended Tooling Stack

Code Quality Analysis:

• SonarQube or SonarCloud - Industry standard, integrates with Git
• CodeClimate - Developer-friendly quality metrics
• Snyk or WhiteSource - Security & dependency analysis

---

## The Composite "Developer Value Score" (DVS)

Create a weighted index combining:

DVS = (0.35 × Business Impact) +
(0.30 × Code Quality) +
(0.20 × Collaboration) +
(0.15 × Engineering Excellence)

Why this matters to SH+:

• Predictability: Identify bottlenecks and capacity planning
• Quality Gates: Prevent technical debt accumulation
• Talent Development: Data-driven coaching and recognition
• Risk Mitigation: Spot knowledge silos and fragile code areas

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation

• Integrate SonarQube with CodeCommit
• Establish baseline metrics collection
• Create Jira-Git linking standards

### Phase 2: Dashboard Development

• Build initial reporting dashboards
• Pilot with 2-3 teams for calibration
• Gather feedback and refine weights

### Phase 3: Rollout & Culture

• Organization-wide deployment
• Train managers on metric interpretation
• Establish quarterly review cadence

---

## Critical Success Factors

Do's:

• ✅ Use metrics for team improvement, not individual punishment
• ✅ Combine quantitative data with qualitative peer feedback
• ✅ Review and adjust weights quarterly
• ✅ Make dashboards transparent and accessible

Don'ts:

• ❌ Gamify individual metrics (creates perverse incentives)
• ❌ Use as sole basis for performance reviews
• ❌ Compare developers across vastly different domains
• ❌ Set arbitrary targets without context

---

## Next Steps

1. Stakeholder Alignment: Schedule sessions
2. Tool Evaluation: Run SonarQube (or similar) POC with one team (2 sprints)
